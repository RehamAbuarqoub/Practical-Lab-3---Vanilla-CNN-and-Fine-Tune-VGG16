# Practical-Lab-3-Vanilla-CNN-and-Fine-Tune-VGG16
This is the practical lab 3 for Fundamental of Machine Learning Framework


# Lab 3 overview

In this lab, we will work on Cat and Dogs dataset which contains 25,000 image, we will use 5000 image and apply the models which use in deep learning engineering. And fine-tune it for the specific task at-hand.
# Dataset
In this lab, we use an Open Data license about cat and dogs images
